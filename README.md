# SimulatorCLI
 Simulator has a console title, a greeting message obtained with the help of Environment.UserName - a property which returns the name of the user logged in this session. 
 Then, the OS version and machine name are displayed with the help of Environment.OSVersion and Environment.MachineName. 
 This will be also returned when typing ‘home’ command, but only initially it will be animated as it is typed at the moment. 
 Please, run the code to understand what it means.

The commands available are:

'clear' -- clears the CLI simulator window
'exit' -- closes the CLI simulator window
'help' -- returns the list of available commands
'home' -- returns to start

I think that a better version of this will be to add commands description, initial banner and message for wrong command from file, to have the possibility to configure easily.
